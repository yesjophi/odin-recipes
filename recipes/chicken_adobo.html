        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This savoury Filipino dish which utilises both soy sauce and vinegar is sure to blow you away. Very little prep work required and very quick to make if you don't include marinating time.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>900g Boneless chicken thighs</li>
            <li>1/3 cups of dark soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 cups of rice/cane vinegar</li>
            <li>3-8 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>1 whole brown onion</li>
            <li>Black peppercorns</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tbsp of mirin (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix dark soy sauce, crushed garlic, black peppercorns and mirin into a large bowl</li>
            <li>Add your boneless chicken thighs into the bowl and ensure that the meat is properly coated. Leave to marinate for at least 2 hours, ideally overnight.</li>
            <li>Heat a pan on medium heat. Dice an onion whilst waiting. Add a neutral cooking oil to the pan.</li>
            <li>Once the pan is hot, add onion to pan and saute until translucent.</li>
            <li>Get your chicken and allow the marinade to drip back into the bowl before adding into the pan. The chicken does not need to be completely dry but allow the majority of marinate to run off.</li>
            <li>Once chicken is browned, flip over and allow the other side to brown</li>
            <li>Add the rest of marinade into the pan once chicken is browned on both sides. Turn down heat to lowest and allow chicken to cook for 10-15 minutes or until cooked through. Turn periodically.</li>
            <li>Separate the chicken into your serving plate once cooked.</li>
            <li>If the sauce is still too runny for your liking, allow the sauce to reduce further before moving onto the next step</li>
            <li>Add brown sugar to the sauce in the pan and keep mixing until the sugar is completely dissolved.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and pour the remains within the pan over the chicken</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
